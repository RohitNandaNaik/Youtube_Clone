# Youtube Clone

A Youtube clone website made using HTML and CSS would feature a similar layout and functionality to the popular video sharing platform. The homepage would likely include a header with a logo and navigation menu, a search bar, and sections for trending videos, recommended videos, and subscribed channels.

Each video would have a thumbnail image, title, view count, and options to like, dislike, comment, and share. Users could also subscribe to channels, create playlists, and upload their own videos.

The website would have a clean and modern design, with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. The use of CSS would allow for customization of colors, fonts, and other visual elements.

Overall, the Youtube clone website made using HTML and CSS would provide a user-friendly platform for sharing and watching videos, with a similar look and feel to the original site.
